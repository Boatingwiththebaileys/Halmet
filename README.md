# HALMET Firmware

This is based on the original code but adds a BME280 sensor for engine room monitoring, 2x 1-wire sensors (exhaust + another), Engine temperature monitoring via a resistive sensor (A3), oil pressure monitoring via a resistive sensor (A4), A2 will just show voltage, and A1 is for fuel tank monitoring via an existing display. 

On the digital side, D1 is for Tacho pickup and D2 is for a float switch monitoring the bilge for water. D3 is enabled but doing nothing at this stage. D4 unused.

Code is currently in test as of Sept 2025
